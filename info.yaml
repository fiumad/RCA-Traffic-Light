# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "Traffic Light Circuit"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "This circuit simulates a Traffic Light by cycling through Green, Yellow, and Red lights."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      A 10KHz clock signal gets stepped down by a series of toggle flip flops until it is roughly the speed necessary for a traffic light cycle. A state
      machine then uses the clock signal to cycle through three states: Green, Yellow, and Red.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      So long as the circuit is powered and the green, yellow, and red leds are connected, you should see the traffic light cycle.
